### Building a python script to visualize different sorting algorithms based on user input

##### Installation Steps
* Clone the repository
* Create the virtual environment using python3 -m venv SortingAlgoVisualizer/
* cd SortingAlgoVisualizer
* source bin/activate
* pip3 install matplotlib
* python sorting.py

#### Recommendations
* Convert the script to GUI using Python pygame/tkinter libraries
* Modifying the script to include PathFinding , Binary Search Tree and various other algorithm(s) # This way all the algorithm(s) can be visualized at one place
* Modifying the script to display Time Complexity info
* Updating the visualization to 3D layout

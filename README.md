### Building a python script to visualize different sorting algorithms based on user input

##### Installation Steps
* Clone the repository
* Create the virtual environment using python3 -m venv SortingAlgoVisualizer/
* cd SortingAlgoVisualizer
* source bin/activate
* pip3 install matplotlib
* python sorting.py

#### Recommendations
* Convert the script to GUI using Python pygame/tkinter libraries
* Modifying the script to include PathFinding , Binary Search Tree and various other algorithm(s) (This way all the algorithm(s) can be visualized at one place)
* Modifying the script to display Time Complexity info
* Updating the visualization to 3D layout
* Displaying the flow steps in the pseudo format so that everyone understands the algorithm easily
* Provision for the user to select the layout he want to visualize the algorithm
* Algorithm Comparision chart which describes the iterations & time complexity info based on the user input 

###### Note : This concept was taken from https://github.com/PushkaraSharma/Visualize_DS repository and applied few changes as per my need
